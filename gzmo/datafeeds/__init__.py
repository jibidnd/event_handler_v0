class BaseDataFeed:
    """Base datafeed class.

        ALL BARS MUST BE RIGHT-EDGE-ALIGNED (timestamp for bar signifies end of bar period).

        A datafeed provides data in one of two ways: `publish` and `fetch`.

        `publish` publishes data to the data socket, which can be specified after initialization.
        `fetch` returns the next record when called.

        Attributes:
            topic (str): The topic the datafeed will be published under (in a PUB socket).
            zmq_context (ZMQ Context): ZMQ context instance for publishing.
            from_beginning (bool): Indicates whether to re-execute the query.
            start_sync (threading.Event): can be used to sync starting times between multiple datafeeds.
                To use it, simply assign `datafeed.start_sync` to a common threading.Event() instance,
                start all the datafeeds, and `set` the threading.Event() instance.
            main_shutdown_flag (threading.Event): If threading is used, this event can be set to signal that the main session has shut down.
            shutdown_flag (threading.Event): If threading is used, this event can be set to signal the datafeed to shut down.
